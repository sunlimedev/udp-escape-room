# UDP Escape Room
This project was developed to utilize the User Datagram Protocol in an interesting way. Gather clues from an alarm clock radio to escape the room you've found yourself in. You may need to look up a few things.

This code was written entirely by me. There is no AI code in this project. Gemini Nano Banana Pro was used to create the lock images and alarm clock image. The images were modified after generation.

# How to Play
1. Move all project files into a Python project in your preferred IDE.
2. Ensure that the Python packages listed at the top of `tower.py` and `receiver.py` are installed on your system or in your virtual environment.
3. Adjust the `server_ip` variable on line 244 of `receiver.py` to reflect the ip address of the device running `tower.py`.
4. Run `tower.py`, then run `receiver.py`.
