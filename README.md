# UDP Escape Room
Simple escape-room-esque project for understanding the User Datagram Protocol. This project was developed for CMPEN 461 at Penn State Behrend. This code was written entirely by me. There is no AI code in this project. Gemini Nano Banana Pro was used to create the lock images and alarm clock image.
